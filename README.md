Release Stats now Readable: Dashboards are Dead
Contributor: Kimaya Basu
Project Description: Goal is to create a single, LLM-readable text file that captures Overture’s monthly release statistics in one place. The file will include key data metrics, clear schema and theme descriptions, and pre-injected prompts and instructions to guide interpretation. By consolidating all necessary context into a single artifact, the project centers on enabling accurate statistical reasoning, on-demand plot generation, and minimizing hallucination when an LLM analyzes or explains the data.
